# Space-Time Path Visualization (Time Map)
Providing some information and graphics pertaining to the creation of 3D Space-Time Path Visualizations of GPS data collected for a day. 

## Basics

```
Similiarities:
- Each team carried around a GPS and logged data during the course of a day.
- Sequentially increased elevation of points and lines.

Differences:
- Created spheres of activity where the size of the sphere indicates a greater amount of time spent at a location. 
- Displayed time and activity in relation to environmental risk factors.
```

a. This first option errored out when I ran the application. My assumption is that it is because it is calling a Map Service I created a hosted on a secure platform. I tried to 'Add Item' to my ArcGIS Online and embed security credentials but it was still erroring out. (<a href="https://youtu.be/F-1FVWIzzqo">YouTube Video</a>)
