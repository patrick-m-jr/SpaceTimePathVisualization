# Space-Time Path Visualization (Time Map)
Providing some information and graphics pertaining to the creation of 3D Space-Time Path Visualizations of GPS data collected for a day. 

## Basics

```
Similiarities:
- Each team carried an active GPS and logged data during the course of a day.
- Sequentially increased elevation of points and lines.

Differences:
- Created spheres of activity where the size of the sphere indicates a greater amount of time spent at a location. 
- Displayed time and activity in relation to environmental risk factors.
```

This image deconstructs the geospatial information proivded in this interpretation of a 3D Space-Time Path Visualization: UWT buildings, GPS point data, polylines generated from GPS points, point density rasters, and 3D time-spheres. Additionally, this graphic provides a simplified workflow for the creation of the map.

## Results

Here, the data is combined. Generally, the vertical increase in the features is representative of time of day: the lower to the ground, the earlier in the day it is. Collection occurred on the June 29th, 2018, roughly between the time of 8am - 10pm.
